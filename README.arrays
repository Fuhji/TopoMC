Okay, this is starting to work.
Problem 1: we do not have a good way to set the spawn point.
Temporary solution: I suggest one to the user when generating numpy arrays.  I then set it by hand with mce.py afterwards.
Permanent solution: dunno.  arguments to ./BuildWorlds.py ?

Problem 2: not parallelized yet.

Problem 3: no Bravo version yet.
