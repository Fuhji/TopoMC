A rough to-do list, mostly in the desired order:

Allow disabling of new features
 - some folks just want pretty
 - others want quick terrain visualization
 - break world generation into phases (terrain, ore, trees, plants, buildings)
Test and drivers for all functions
 - maybe even comments!
Convert most print output to logging statements
 - boy this is spammy
 - especially GetDataset.py!
Schematics and equipping the player
 - in progress
 - don't forget the bed in the safe house!
Normal stuff underground!
 - ore done, what about caves?
 - I bet someone's done it better -- look for add-a-dungeon code!
Clean up terrain.py
 - move terrain types into abstract routines to support more land cover types
Put buildings in developed areas
 - need to do this without interfering with roads in the future?
