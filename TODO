To do:

Add tiling functionality - 256x256 images should work well
 - this will make bigger maps and better scaling possible!
Add grass and ice
 - not sure how to do this via JCraft, need help
Add randomness
 - X% chance of stone or dirt, etc.
Add trees
 - certain trees in certain types of forest, of course
Histogram of land cover types in BuildWorld.js
 - requires populating array
Normal stuff underground!
 - no idea!
