A rough to-do list, mostly in the desired order:

Permit disabling of various features in ./BuildWorld.py
 - sometimes the surface is all we need
Trees aren't quite right
 - no more edge cases!
 - place all leaves before all trunks
Convert module print output to logging statements
 - what we have now is pretty spammy
 - keep the stuff in ./Build*.py the way it is

Use decorators for parallel code
 - gotta learn how first
 - must account for temporarily-disabled parallelism
Make more code parallel-friendly code
 - not all numpy code is parallel-friendly
 - ditto for pymclevel

Move from images to arrays
 - permits eventual bravo support
 - can generate larger maps too
Move from zero-based coordinates to "real" coordinates
 - permits eventual *multi-server* bravo support
 - allows multiple maps to be merged easily
Move sealevel and maxdepth code
 - options belong in ./BuildArrays.py
 - variables and check code belong in mcarray

Move crust code to ./WarpElev.sh
 - will generate a new crust dataset once I learn how
Refactor terrain code to not be L01-specific
 - will reduce duplication of code
Support additional datasets
 - ./WarpElev.sh will have to warp/merge all downloaded files
Support additional file types
 - NED 1/9 arc seconds and older landcover types top of list

Test and drivers for all functions
 - maybe even comments!
Schematics and equipping the player
 - in progress
Underground caves
 - no idea how to do this, need suggestions
Put buildings in developed areas
 - need to do this without interfering with roads in the future?
