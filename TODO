To do:

Normal stuff underground!
 - a few ideas, always looking for more!
Full multiprocessing support
 - Pool() isn't working, maybe Manager() will?
More optimization
 - change image module to use aggregates
Test and drivers for all functions
 - maybe even comments!
Schematics and equipping the player
 - pymclevel supports the former but not yet the latter
