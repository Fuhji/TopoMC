To do:

Allow disabling of new features
 - some folks just want pretty
Test and drivers for all functions
 - maybe even comments!
Convert most print output to logging statements
 - boy this is spammy
Schematics and equipping the player
 - in progress
Support multiple USGS chunks per dataset
 - ./image.py needs to be redesigned
Normal stuff underground!
 - ore done, what about caves?
Full multiprocessing support
 - everything works except turning chunks into worlds
Clean up WarpElev.sh
 - only unzip the files we want
Clean up terrain.py
 - move terrain types into abstract routines to support more land cover types
Support NED 1/9 arc seconds
 - is this anything more than downloading?
 - multiple chunks come first!
Put buildings in developed areas
 - need to do this without interfering with roads in the future?
