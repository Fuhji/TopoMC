A rough to-do list, mostly in the desired order:

Allow disabling of new features
 - some folks just want pretty
 - others want quick terrain visualization
 - break world generation into phases (terrain, ore, trees, plants, buildings)
Test and drivers for all functions
 - maybe even comments!
Convert most print output to logging statements
 - boy this is spammy
 - especially GetDatabase.py!
Schematics and equipping the player
 - in progress
 - don't forget the bed in the safe house!
Support multiple USGS chunks per dataset
 - mcarray.py needs to be redesigned as does GetDatabase.py
Normal stuff underground!
 - ore done, what about caves?
 - I bet someone's done it better -- look for add-a-dungeon code!
Full multiprocessing support
 - everything works except turning chunks into worlds
 - test this to make sure
Clean up WarpElev.sh
 - only unzip the files we want
Clean up terrain.py
 - move terrain types into abstract routines to support more land cover types
Support NED 1/9 arc seconds
 - is this anything more than downloading?
 - multiple chunks come first!
Put buildings in developed areas
 - need to do this without interfering with roads in the future?
