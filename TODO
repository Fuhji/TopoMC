To do:

Test and drivers for all functions
 - maybe even comments!
Convert most print output to logging statements
 - boy this is spammy
Schematics and equipping the player
 - in progress
Support multiple USGS chunks per dataset
 - ./image.py needs to be redesigned
Normal stuff underground!
 - a few ideas, always looking for more!
Full multiprocessing support
 - everything works except turning chunks into worlds
Clean up WarpElev.sh
 - only unzip the files we want
