To do:

Test and drivers for all functions
 - maybe even comments!
Convert most print output to logging statements
 - boy this is spammy
More optimization
 - aggregates aren't working, sigh
Schematics and equipping the player
 - pymclevel supports the former but not yet the latter
Support multiple USGS chunks per dataset
 - ./image.py needs to be redesigned
Normal stuff underground!
 - a few ideas, always looking for more!
Full multiprocessing support
 - Pool() isn't working, maybe Manager() will?
