The TopoMC project facilitates the construction of superficially realistic Minecraft worlds leveraging USGS Seamless Map data, specifically the NED and NLCD datasets.

This project generates input files suitable for JCraft (http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1022&t=147476) written by BagelMann.  Always check for the latest version of JCraft from http://genericdeveloper.com/JCraft.zip -- it works on Linux via Mono.

This project includes one small dataset for testing.  Other datasets can be found in the TopoMC-Datasets repository at git@github.com:mathuin/TopoMC-Datasets.git.

Tiling functionality has been added.  The stock configuration will generate a world based on Block Island, RI, at 1:6 scale (both horizontal and vertical).  JCraft is currently very slow, taking two hours to process this input.

To build a Minecraft world based on a dataset, here's what to do:

1.  Build the elevation and land cover images.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./BuildImages.py BlockIsland

2.  Prepare new images for worldbuilding.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ cp ./Images/BlockIsland-test-lcimage.gif lcimage.gif
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ cp ./Images/BlockIsland-test-elevimage.gif elevimage.gif

3. Build a new world!
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ mono ../JCraft/JCraft.exe
    Select 'BuildWorld.js' as a script.
    Select an unused world.
    Click 'Generate'.
