The TopoMC project facilitates the construction of superficially realistic Minecraft worlds leveraging USGS Seamless Map data, specifically the NED and NLCD datasets.

Features include:
 * The project is now pure Python.  The speed is worth it.
 * Both single-player and multi-player worlds can be generated.
 * North is now north!  That math was more annoying than I expected. :-)
 * Simulated bathymetric data based on local terrain.
 * Large datasets can be handled with tiling support.

This project includes one small dataset for testing.  Other datasets can be found in the TopoMC-Datasets repository at git@github.com:mathuin/TopoMC-Datasets.git.

The default spawn point is at the highest point in the dataset.

To build a Minecraft world based on a dataset, here's what to do:

1.  Build the elevation and land cover images.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./BuildImages.py BlockIsland

2. Build a new world!  (warning: this overwrites world 5!)
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./BuildWorld.py BlockIsland

Both BuildImages.py and BuildWorld.py have lots of options!
