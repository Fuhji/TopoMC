The RealMC project facilitates the construction of superficially realistic Minecraft worlds leveraging USGS Seamless Map data, specifically the NED and NLCD datasets.

This project generates input files suitable for JCraft (http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1022&t=147476) written by BagelMann.  Always check for the latest version of JCraft from http://genericdeveloper.com/JCraft.zip -- it works on Linux via Mono.

Currently only small (like 300x200) datasets work, and the only Minecraft worlds that can be generated are scaled 30:1 horizontally and 6:1 vertically.

Here's how to create a dataset:

1.  Create a directory for your dataset.
    Please don't use spaces.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ mkdir Datasets/NewOrleans

2.  Open the USGS Seamless Map and select the region to download.
    http://seamless.usgs.gov/ is the site, select Seamless Viewer.
    Smaller is better right now.

3.  Change the data request to what we need.
    Click 'Modify Data Request'.
    Scroll down to the Elevation section.
    Ensure 'National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1 Arc Second' is checked.
    Set data format to GeoTIFF.
    Scroll down to the Land Cover section.
    Ensure 'National Land Cover Dataset 2001 - Land Cover' is checked.
    Set data format to GeoTIFF.
    Set Maximum size (MB) per piece to 250 MB.
    Click 'Save Changes & Return to Summary'.

4.  Download the elevation and land cover datasets.
    Click 'Download' for NED, wait, save the file.
    Do the same for National Land Cover Dataset.

5.  Move the ZIP files to the directory you created.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ mv ../Downloads/*[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].zip Datasets/NewOrleans

6.  Unzip the ZIP files in place.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ (cd Datasets/NewOrleans && for file in *.zip; do unzip $file; done)

7.  Warp the elevation dataset to match the land cover dataset.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./warpelev.sh NewOrleans

8.  Build the elevation and land cover images.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./mklcelevdata.py NewOrleans

9.  Prepare new images for worldbuilding.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ cp ./Images/NewOrleans-test-lcimage.gif lcimage.gif
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ cp ./Images/NewOrleans-test-elevimage.gif elevimage.gif

10. Build a new world!
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ mono ../JCraft/JCraft.exe
    Select 'BuildWorld.js' as a script.
    Select an unused world.
    Click 'Generate'.

I have retrieved the following datasets:
BlockIsland (304x398, default dataset for testing)
Boston (469, 396) (works)
Manhattan (701, 861) (just too big right now)
NewOrleans (3399, 2615) (too big!)
Portland (2849, 2814) (too big!)
SFBA (642, 659) (works!)
Vermont (5989, 9272) (way too big!)
WashDC (977, 984) (too big)

To do:

Add tiling functionality - 256x256 images should work well
 - this will make bigger maps and better scaling possible!
Add grass and ice
 - not sure how to do this via JCraft, need help
Add randomness
 - X% chance of stone or dirt, etc.
Add trees
 - certain trees in certain types of forest, of course
Histogram of land cover types in BuildWorld.js
 - requires populating array
Normal stuff underground!
 - no idea!
