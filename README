The TopoMC project facilitates the construction of superficially realistic Minecraft worlds leveraging USGS, specifically the NED and NLCD datasets.

This project relies heavily on pymclevel which can also be found on github at https://github.com/mcedit/pymclevel.git

Version 0.9 includes changes to support the most up-to-date version of pymclevel (as of 2012 Feb 04).  The new precompiled NBT module really helps!

Major changes:

 * The array and world code has been replaced with region-based code which improve accuracy while saving CPU and memory.  The new commands to download, prepare, and build regions are documented below.

* GPGPU support has been added. Yes, your video card can help you build Minecraft worlds!  This latest feature relies on PyOpenCL, so see http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl for more information.  

 * The landcover code has been rewritten to support the usage of MCEdit schematics as templates for certain areas, specifically croplands (farms) and developed areas.  MCEdit is not required to use TopoMC, only to modify or replace the example schematics.  It can be found at http://davidvierra.com/mcedit/download.html.

 * The test dataset has been removed.

 * The safehouse has been removed, but the default spawn point is still at the highest point in the dataset.

How to use TopoMC:

The best way to get latitude and longitude is through Google Maps.  Choose your chunk of the planet (still limited to the United States and its possessions, alas) and right-click to place latlong markers in the upper left and lower right of the region you wish to model.  This will give you the maximum and minimum latitude and longitude (Y and X in this model) values.

Next, here's what to do!

1.  Retrieve the region from the USGS and prepare it for processing.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./GetRegion.py --name Provincetown --ymax 42.0901 --ymin 42.0091 --xmin -70.2611 --xmax -70.1100

2.  Construct the Minecraft world based on the region.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./BuildRegion.py --name Provincetown

GetRegion.py has a number of optional arguments not shown above.

 * Tile size can be changed.
   The default tile size is 256x256, but it can be changed.  The only requirement is that it be a multiple of 16.  An example would be "--tilesize 64".

 * Horizontal and vertical scaling can be changed.
   The horizontal and vertical scale, both of which default to 6, can be changed independently.  The minimum horizontal scale is 1 with a practical maximum of 30.  The minimum vertical scale is more complex, and essentially depends on the elevation change between the highest point in the region and sea level.  An example scale would be "--scale 1 --vscale 1".  Should the requested scale exceed valid parameters, the software will adjust the scale after informing the user.

 * Sealevel and maximum depth can be changed.
   Sometimes the minimum vertical scale is too high.  One way to improve this situation is to lower the sealevel from its default of 64 to something lower such as 16 or 8.  The maximum depth should also be lowered as well.  Keep in mind that this may have unexpected effects on ore distribution!  An example sealevel and maximum depth would be "--sealevel 16 --maxdepth 8".

 * Elevation can be trimmed!
   When lowering the sealevel isn't enough to reach your desired vertical scale, excess elevation can be trimmed.  Elevation is considered excess if it is between sea level and the lowest point on the region.  For example, if a region were selected such that its surface was between 200 and 300 meters above sea level, the 200 meters between sea level and the lowest point on the region could be trimmed.  An example trim would be "--trim 200".  If the trim value requested exceeds the valid limits, the software will adjust the trim value to the maximum allowed after informing the user.
