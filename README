The TopoMC project facilitates the construction of superficially realistic Minecraft worlds leveraging USGS Seamless Map data, specifically the NED and NLCD datasets.

This project generates input files suitable for JCraft (http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1022&t=147476) written by BagelMann.  Always check for the latest version of JCraft from http://genericdeveloper.com/JCraft.zip -- it works on Linux via Mono.

This project includes one small dataset for testing.  Other datasets can be found in the TopoMC-Datasets repository at git@github.com:mathuin/TopoMC-Datasets.git.

The old blockiness is gone!  Land cover should be much smoother now.

Tiling functionality has been added.  The stock configuration will generate a world based on Block Island, RI, at 1:6 scale (both horizontal and vertical).

Simulated bathymetric data is now enabled by default.  Changing the slope and maximum depth may be interesting -- try it!

The default spawn point is at the highest point in the dataset, and currently has a two-story glass-and-stone building lit up with torches as a safe haven.

To build a Minecraft world based on a dataset, here's what to do:

1.  Build the elevation and land cover images.
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ ./BuildImages.py BlockIsland

2. Build a new world!
    jmt@belle:~/TopoMC$ mono ../JCraft/JCraft.exe
    Select 'BuildWorld.js' as a script, it defaults to BlockIsland.
    Select an unused world.
    Click 'Generate'.

BuildImages.py now has option parsing support: try "./BuildImages.py -h".
