The accuracy assessment selection methods were developed to minimize spatial autocorrelation between the training and accuracy assessment. The first pool of accuracy assessment sites came from field data and photo interpretation of black and white digital orthophotos and digital color infrared imagery (primarily Ikonos data).  These sites were collected prior to initial mapping and were collected at the same time as the training data. The sites were selected to capture the physical and spectral diversity of the land cover. After the first criteria was met, the accuracy assessment sites were buffered to see if they fell within 1000 meters of another accuracy assessment site of the same class or within 1000 meters of a training site of the same class. Those that fell within the 1000 meter buffer were eliminated. All sites were to be from a homogeneous 3x3 area.  After an analysis of the point distribution, it became clear that there were not enough samples for every class.  The remaining points were selected from the initial draft final classification and had to be a homogeneous 3x3 area.Sampling was limited to areas where there was high resolution color infrared imagery. The imagery included the previous Ikonos imagery, but also included an additional 20 scenes of Ikonos imagery. The additional Ikonos imagery provided sampling areas across the entire study area.  Classes which had a proportionally larger representative land area had larger numbers of samples . When possible, we tried to identify 50 samples of each of the classes.  Exceptions were for the following classes (actual sample numbers): Cultivated Crops (37) - Grassland/Herbaceous (20)- Evergreen Forest (40) - Mixed Forest (28) - Scrub/Shrub (21) - Palustrine Forest Wetland (33) - Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (28) Palustrine Emergent Wetland (20)- Estuarine Emergent Wetland (38) - Unconsolidated Shore (17) - Bare Land (23) - Palustrine Aquatic Bed (4).A total of 518 accuracy assessment points were used excluding urban classes. 572 accuracy assessment points were used including urban points. All classes have a minimum of 50 accuracy assessment points except for the classes mentioned above. These classes are limited in the study area and to some extent in the imagery that was available to sample from.<P>Post-Processing Steps: NoneKnown Problems: NoneSpatial Filters: None</dd><dt><em>Quantitative_Attribute_Accuracy_Assessment:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Attribute_Accuracy_Value:</em>  85.1</dt><dt><em>Attribute_Accuracy_Explanation:</em>  <dd>Accuracy value obtained using 518 accuracy points compared against the classification produced.

The land-cover database also includes three additional metadata layers that provide users a spatial node map of the land cover classification.  The three layers are: (a)  a spatial node map of the land cover classification, (b) a spatial confidence map of the land cover classification, and, (c) a text file of logical statements related to the land cover classification.<P>Conceptually, the descriptive tree is a classification tree generated by using the final minimum-map- unit land cover product (1 acre) as training data, and Landsat and other ancillary data as predictors. The goal of the descriptive tree is to summarize the effects of boosted trees (10 sequential classification trees) into a single condensed decision tree that can be used as a diagnostic tool for the classification process.  This descriptive tree can be used to assess the relative importance of each of the input data sets on each land cover class. Such information may also be useful to customize the minimum-mapping-unit classification to meet a user's specific needs through raster modeling. Descriptive trees usually capture 60 to 80% of the information from the original land cover data.<P>The leaf or terminal nodes of the descriptive tree are assigned to sequential numbers (called node numbers) and mapped across the entire mapping zone on a pixel-by-pixel basis. These node numbers can then be matched with the various conditional statements associated with each respective terminal node.  This spatial layer appears similar to a cluster map, but is the result of a supervised classification - not an unsupervised clustering. This node map can potentially be used as input by users to customize NLCD land cover, by linking the spatial extent of an individual node with the rules of the conditional statement.<P>The  Land Cover spatial classification confidence data layer is provided to users to help determine the per-pixel spatial confidence of the NLCD 2001 land cover prediction from the descriptive tree. The C5 algorithm produces an estimate (a value between 0% and 100%) that indicates the confidence of rule predictions at each node based on the training data.  This spatial confidence map should be considered as only one indicator of relative reliability of the land cover classification, rather than a precise estimate. Users should be aware that this estimate is made based on only training data, and is derived from a generalized descriptive decision tree that reproduces the final land cover data.  However, this layer provides valuable insight for a user to determine the risk or confidence they choose to place in each pixel of land cover.<P>A logic statement from a descriptive tree classification describes each classification rule for each classified pixel.  An example of the logic statement follows:<P>IF tasseled-cap wetness &gt; 140 and imperviousness  = 0 and canopy density &lt; 4, then classify as Water<P>This logic file can be used in combination with the spatial node map to identify classification logic and allow modifications of the classification based on user's knowledge and/or additional data sets.<P>Additional information may be found at <A HREF="http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k_nlcd.asp">&lt;http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k_nlcd.asp&gt;</A>.</dd><dt><em>Completeness_Report:</em>  <dd>This NLCD product of mapping zone 65 Land Cover layer is the version dated September 26,2006.</dd><dt><em>Positional_Accuracy:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:</em>  N/A</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:</em>  N/A</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><em>Lineage:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Process_Step:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Process_Description:</em>  <dd>This dataset was created by Sanborn Mapping Company. This version of the classification is the late-date (2000-era). The study area is the coastal zone 65 region. An early-date (1995-era) classification is also available for the same area.Summary:This section outlines the classification procedure for the zone 65 C-CAP Late Date map. The three dates of imagery were first reviewed for image quality and shifts between image dates. Training points were used as the dependent variable in a CART (Classification Analysis by Regression Tree)approach. Derivative data layers (NDVI, Tasseled Cap) were calculated from the TM data and were used as additional independent variables in the analysis. There were 3 major versions of the map prior to a draft map: 1) the provisional map, 2) automated (incl. draft and final) and 3) final edited. The provisional map was developed prior to field work to give an idea of potential areas to sample. This rough map represented the first output from the CART classification routine. Ancillary data (DEMs, etc) and spectral data were used in this and all other CART models. The final automated map had additional points from the field and photo interpretation added. Points were continually added until the best possible model was developed. This represented a fully automated product. This product was then altered by hand edits to refine the classification. In addition, a percent impervious data layer developed from TM data using high resolution imagery, was imbedded into the classification to define the developed classes. This produced the final-with-edits version which is the final version of the classification and is the one described here.Pre-processing steps:Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological Survey)/EROS. The Sanborn staff reviewed the spectral and spatial quality of the imagery. Areas that were greater than 1-2 pixels off were sent back to USGS for reprocessing. The data was geo-referenced to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of NAD83. The data units are in meters. The zone 65 TM data was delivered in the form of USGS zone mosaics. The data included three dates of TM- leaf-on, leaf-off, and spring.

Classes that would be more difficult to collect from air photos were targeted for field data collection. To meet these goals, Sanborn stratified the image into spectral clusters and located the field sites throughout the study area based on these. In addition to these pre-arranged sites, Sanborn collected points while driving between locations. Due to limited time and accessibility, not all polygons were assessed in the field.  Those that we did not visit on the ground were labeled with digital orthophotographs or Ikonos data if it was available. Both training and validation points were collected together. See the accuracy assessment section to see how the points were split into training and validation points. Sanborn used laptop computers and GPS (Global Positioning System) to correctly locate field points on the TM imagery. Software downloaded from the Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was used to connect the Garmin GPS to the laptop computer and ESRI's ArcView software.  Sanborn's programmer developed an ArcMap application that allowed entry of location and field notes with a click of the mouse. These data were stored in a shapefile. Items that were collected were:Land Cover characterizationSpecial conditions and remarksPhotograph NumberDate/time location<P>The data and equipment used for the fieldwork are as follows:<P>Ancillary datasets:TIGER 2000NLCD - mosaicked into zonesState road map and Delorme state atlas www.delorme.com<P>Hardware: with ArcView/ArcGIS and dataGARMIN GPS modules and external antennae, redundant datacablesCameras devices (Floppy Drives, CD Burners, external HDD)Extra batteries (lap-top and GPS)Mobile phonesSystem backup CD's with data and softwareCompass notebooks with instructions and road maps withpre-determined routes Wetland and Vegetation Field Guides<P>Imagery:Image data for each zoneInitial classificationsClassification:<P>After the field points for training were collected, they were combined with photo-interpreted points and used as the dependent variable in a CART classification approach. Many layers tested as independent layers. They included three dates of spectral and tasseled cap imagery, DEM, slope, aspect, texture, band indices (NDVI, Moisture, NDVI-Green, shape indices fractal dimension, compactness, convexity, and form). Statistical analyses and visual inspection of the output was used to eliminate data that was redundant or not useful in the classification. Additional training points were added to help reduce some of the confusion between classes. The rough classification was created at the end of this process using only the CART discrete decision-tree software. A provisional classification was produced by applying spatial models using ancillary data to the rough classification. The final automated map was then edited using hand editing techniques while using high resolution imagery as reference data. Independently of this process, impervious data layers for Zone 65 were created. This layer was developed from Regression Tree and used impervious classifications from IKONOS imagery to predict pixel level percent impervious at the TM pixel level. The continuous percent impervious data was thresholded to produce the developed categories and imbedded into the final map.<P>Attributes for this product are as follows:<br>0 Background<br>1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc)<br>2 High Intensity Developed<br>3 Medium Intensity Developed<br>4 Low Intensity Developed<br>5 Open Spaces Developed<br>6 Cultivated Land<br>7 Pasture/Hay<br>8 Grassland<br>9 Deciduous Forest<br>10 Evergreen Forest<br>11 Mixed Forest<br>12 Scrub/Shrub<br>13 Palustrine Forested Wetland<br>14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland<br>15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland<br>16 Estuarine Forested Wetland<br>17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland<br>18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland<br>19 Unconsolidated Shore<br>20 Bare Land<br>21 Water<br>22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed<br>23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed<br>24 Tundra (N/A)<br>25 Snow/Ice (N/A)<br><P>Ancillary Datasets:Non-TM image datasets used are DEM (Digital Elevation Model), slope, aspect, positional index, NWI, NLCD, TIGER2000, field-collected points, photo-interpreted points, zone 65 GAP reclassified by NOAA (Gap Analysis Program),Census data (housing and population density), Ecoregions.<P>QA/QC Process:There were several QA/QC steps involved in the creation of this product.

For coastal zones mapped by NOAA and/or NOAA contractors, the land cover dataset classification codes and the source dataset for classification of urban areas is different.  For national consistency, an additional process step was added to cross-walk the NOAA class codes to standard NLCD 2001 class codes described in the Entity and Attribute Information section of this document.  NOAA urban pixel values were replaced with values determined from the NLCD 2001 percent imperviousness mapping product.  The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section).  The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness &lt; 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness &gt; 79%).<P>The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m  pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a &quot;smart eliminate&quot; algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.</dd><dt><em>Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation:</em>  Landsat ETM, DOQQ, USDA, FIA, DEM, USGS/EROS, IKONOS</dt><dt><em>Process_Date:</em>  Unknown</dt><dt><em>Source_Produced_Citation_Abbreviation:</em>  USGS NLCD</dt><dt><em>Process_Contact:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Organization_Primary:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Organization:</em>  U.S. Geological Survey</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Contact_Position:</em>  Customer Services Representative</dt><dt><em>Contact_Address:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Address_Type:</em>  mailing and physical address</dt><dt><em>Address:</em>  USGS/EROS</dt><dt><em>Address:</em>  47914 252nd Street</dt><dt><em>City:</em>  Sioux Falls</dt><dt><em>State_or_Province:</em>  SD</dt><dt><em>Postal_Code:</em>  57198-0001</dt><dt><em>Country:</em>  USA</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Contact_Voice_Telephone:</em>  605/594-6151</dt><dt><em>Contact_TDD/TTY_Telephone:</em>  605/594-6933</dt><dt><em>Contact_Facsimile_Telephone:</em>  605/594-6589</dt><dt><em>Contact_Electronic_Mail_Address:</em>  custserv@usgs.gov</dt><dt><em>Hours_of_Service:</em>  0800 - 1600 CT, M - F (-6h CST/-5h CDT GMT)</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><A NAME="3"></A><hr><dl><dt><em>Spatial_Data_Organization_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Direct_Spatial_Reference_Method:</em>  Raster</dt><dt><em>Raster_Object_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Raster_Object_Type:</em>  Pixel</dt><dt><em>Row_Count:</em> 409</dt><dt><em>Column_Count:</em> 324</dt><dt><em>Vertical_Count:</em>  1</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><A NAME="4"></A><hr><dl><dt><em>Spatial_Reference_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Horizontal_Coordinate_System_Definition:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Planar:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Map_Projection:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Map_Projection_Name:</em>  Albers Conical Equal Area</dt><dt><em>Albers_Conical_Equal_Area:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Standard_Parallel:</em>  29.500000</dt><dt><em>Standard_Parallel:</em>  45.500000</dt><dt><em>Longitude_of_Central_Meridian:</em>  -96.000000</dt><dt><em>Latitude_of_Projection_Origin:</em>  23.000000</dt><dt><em>False_Easting:</em>  0.000000</dt><dt><em>False_Northing:</em>  0.000000</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><em>Planar_Coordinate_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Planar_Coordinate_Encoding_Method:</em>  row and column</dt><dt><em>Coordinate_Representation:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Abscissa_Resolution:</em>  30.000000</dt><dt><em>Ordinate_Resolution:</em>  30.000000</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Planar_Distance_Units:</em>  meters</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><em>Geodetic_Model:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Horizontal_Datum_Name:</em>  North American Datum of 1983</dt><dt><em>Ellipsoid_Name:</em>  Geodetic Reference System 80</dt><dt><em>Semi-major_Axis:</em>  6378137.000000</dt><dt><em>Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio:</em>  298.257222</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><A NAME="5"></A><hr><dl><dt><em>Entity_and_Attribute_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Detailed_Description:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Entity_Type:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Entity_Type_Label:</em>  Layer_1</dt><dt><em>Entity_Type_Definition:</em>  NLDC Land Cover Layer</dt><dt><em>Entity_Type_Definition_Source:</em>  National Land Cover Database 2001</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Attribute:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Attribute_Label:</em>  ObjectID</dt><dt><em>Attribute_Definition:</em>  Internal feature number</dt><dt><em>Attribute_Definition_Source:</em>  ESRI</dt><dt><em>Attribute_Domain_Values:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Unrepresentable_Domain:</em>  <dd>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><em>Attribute:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Attribute_Label:</em>  Count</dt><dt><em>Attribute_Definition:</em>  <dd>A nominal integer value that designates the number of pixels that have each value in the file; histogram column in ERDAS Imagine raster attributes table</dd><dt><em>Attribute_Definition_Source:</em>  NLCD 2001</dt><dt><em>Attribute_Domain_Values:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Unrepresentable_Domain:</em>  Integer</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><em>Attribute:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Attribute_Label:</em>  Value</dt><dt><em>Attribute_Definition:</em>  <dd>Land Cover Class Code Value.
